# Research Interest Profile

This folder contains structured documentation of my research interests, designed for both academic presentation and AI-assisted research automation.

## Overview

My research interests span across two main domains: **Mathematics** and **Computer Science**, with a focus on interdisciplinary connections between these fields.

### Mathematics 
- **Algebraic Geometry, Graph Theory & Combinatorics**: Study of algebraic varieties, toric varieties, positivity in algebraic geometry, Newton-Okounkov bodies, convex geometry, monomial ideals, edge ideals, syzygies, simple graphs, extremal graph theory, algebraic graph theory, and combinatorial optimization

### Computer Science & AI
- **AI Algorithms**: Machine learning theory, deep learning, and related AI research
- **Computational Algebraic Geometry**: Symbolic computation, Gröbner bases, and algorithmic approaches to algebraic geometry

```

## File Contents

### `math.json`
Contains structured information about mathematical research interests, including:
- Algebraic geometry research areas and proficiency levels
- Combinatorics and graph theory specializations
- Mathematical tools and methodologies
- Current research focus and keywords for literature search

*Note: Content is written in Chinese for better expression of nuanced academic concepts.*

### `cs-ai.json`
Documents computer science and AI-related research profile, including:
- AI algorithms and machine learning interests
- Computational algebraic geometry background
- Programming tools and frameworks
- Research keywords for automated literature surveys

*Note: Content is written in Chinese for better expression of nuanced academic concepts.*

## Purpose

This structured approach serves multiple objectives:

1. **Academic Presentation**: Clearly communicate research interests to collaborators and the academic community
2. **AI Integration**: Provide context for AI assistants to deliver relevant, field-appropriate responses
3. **Literature Automation**: Enable automated literature reviews and paper recommendations based on research focus
4. **Research Assistance**: Facilitate AI-powered paper reading, analysis, and cross-field connection identification

## Usage

The JSON-structured profiles can be directly referenced in AI interactions to:
- Receive research-level explanations tailored to your background
- Get literature recommendations aligned with your interests  
- Identify connections between different research areas
- Automate literature surveys across multiple domains
- Assist with technical paper comprehension and analysis

This documentation bridges the gap between human research interests and AI-assisted academic workflows, with Chinese content enabling more precise expression of complex academic concepts.
